            <h2>Introduction to Waste Management</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this course on waste management in South Africa! Proper waste management is crucial for
                protecting our environment and public health.</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>South Africa generates approximately <strong>54 million tonnes</strong> of general waste each year,
                    with only about <strong>10%</strong> being recycled.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In this course, you'll learn about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The current state of waste management in South Africa</li>
                <li>Recycling practices and how to improve them</li>
                <li>The connection between waste and climate change</li>
                <li>What you can do to make a difference</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Waste Management in SA Section -->
        <div class="section" id="section2">
            <h2>Waste Management in South Africa</h2>
            <p>South Africa faces significant challenges in waste management. With rapid urbanization and population
                growth, waste generation continues to increase.</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>About 90% of South Africa's waste ends up in landfills, with only 10% being recycled or reused.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Key issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate waste collection services in informal settlements</li>
                <li>Limited landfill space, with many sites approaching capacity</li>
                <li>Illegal dumping, which poses health and environmental risks</li>
                <li>Limited awareness about proper waste disposal practices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The South African government has implemented the National Waste Management Strategy to address these
                challenges, but individual action is also crucial.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Recycling Section -->
        <div class="section" id="section3">
            <h2>Recycling in South Africa</h2>
            <p>Recycling plays a vital role in reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and conserving natural
                resources.</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>South Africa's recycling industry creates over 100,000 jobs, showing how waste management can
                    contribute to economic development.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Commonly recycled materials in South Africa include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paper and cardboard:</strong> About 70% of recoverable paper is recycled</li>
                <li><strong>Plastics:</strong> PET plastic bottles have a recycling rate of about 65%</li>
                <li><strong>Glass:</strong> Approximately 42% of glass packaging is recycled</li>
                <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Around 80% of beverage cans are recycled</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To improve recycling rates, many municipalities have implemented separation-at-source programs where
                households separate recyclables from other waste.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Climate Impacts Section -->
        <div class="section" id="section4">
            <h2>Climate Impacts of Waste</h2>
            <p>Waste management has significant implications for climate change, primarily through greenhouse gas
                emissions.</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>Landfills are the third largest source of methane emissions in South Africa, a greenhouse gas 25
                    times more potent than carbon dioxide.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Key connections between waste and climate change:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organic waste in landfills produces methane as it decomposes</li>
                <li>Transporting waste to landfills consumes fuel and generates emissions</li>
                <li>Manufacturing products from recycled materials typically uses less energy than virgin materials</li>
                <li>Reducing waste prevents emissions associated with extraction, manufacturing, and disposal</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By improving waste management practices, South Africa can significantly reduce its greenhouse gas
                emissions.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Taking Action Section -->
        <div class="section" id="section5">
            <h2>Taking Action: What You Can Do</h2>
            <p>Everyone has a role to play in improving waste management and reducing climate impacts. Here's what you
                can do:</p>

            <div class="facts">
                <p>If every South African household recycled just one plastic bottle per day, we could divert over 18
                    billion bottles from landfills each year!</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Reduce:</strong> Choose products with less packaging, avoid single-use items, and buy only what
                you need.</p>

            <p><strong>Reuse:</strong> Find new uses for items instead of throwing them away. Donate usable goods to
                others.</p>

            <p><strong>Recycle:</strong> Separate your recyclables and use local recycling programs. Know what can be
                recycled in your area.</p>

            <p><strong>Compost:</strong> Turn food scraps and garden waste into nutrient-rich compost for your plants.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Advocate:</strong> Support policies and businesses that promote sustainable waste management
                practices.</p>
